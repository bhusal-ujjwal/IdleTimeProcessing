# Idle Time Processing
Idle Time Processing using QT GUI toolkit and C++. Application able to process user-define tasks in IDLE timer event handler.

## The application have the following features:
choice of one time-consuming algorithm (PI number calculation, prime number calculation, etc.)
provide input fields for initial algorithm parameters (for example, the amount of PI digits)
provide at least three buttons:
start - will start the computation
pause -will pause the computation (algorithm can continue)
stop - will terminate the computation
provide output field with the algorithm result
Provide the "indicator" of computation - for example, the progress bar or simply some label showing the code is at the stage of computing/done. 
The application must remain responsive all the time.
